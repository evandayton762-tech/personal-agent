# Skill Specification: Lead Generation

This document defines the MVP for generating a simple lead‑generation site or landing page.

## One‑Page Site MVP

1. **Generate Static Page**: Create a simple one‑page site with copy and a call‑to‑action form based on provided inputs (e.g., product description, target audience). Use an HTML template or builder that supports free tiers.
2. **Deploy to Free Host**: Publish the page to a free hosting provider (e.g., GitHub Pages or Netlify) if selected. If deployment is not required, provide the static files for manual hosting.
3. **Configure Form Submission**: Connect the contact form to a Google Sheet or the user’s inbox (subject to email access consent) using a free form backend like Formspree or Google Forms.
4. **Test Form Flow**: Submit a test entry through the deployed form and verify that it appears in the destination sheet or email.
5. **Capture Evidence**: Record the live URL, a screenshot of the published page, and a copy of the test entry as evidence.
6. **Schedule Updates**: Allow scheduling of periodic updates or refreshes (e.g., content tweaks or weekly performance summaries) via the scheduler.
7. **Park Conditions**: If no suitable free hosting option is available or if email access is denied for form integration, park the task and propose alternative hosting or form solutions.
