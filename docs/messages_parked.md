# Standard Parked Messages

When the agent cannot proceed, it sends a ParkedItem message. These templates define the standard wording for common reasons.

## Paywall

> I encountered a paywall while attempting to complete this step. Since we operate under a free‑only policy, I have paused the task. You can either provide consent for payment or choose one of the free alternatives suggested.

## Captcha or Two‑Factor Authentication

> A captcha or two‑factor authentication prompt requires your intervention. Please complete the verification in the open window or provide the one‑time code if permitted. Once done, let me know and I will resume the task.

## Missing Secret

> A required secret (e.g., API key or password) is missing. Please provide it through the secure secrets manager. I cannot proceed until this value is supplied.

## Verification Required

> An external service requires account or email verification. Please check your email or the service’s dashboard to complete the verification. Notify me once it’s done so I can continue.

## Quiet Hours

> The requested action falls within quiet hours (02:00–06:00 local). I have deferred execution to the next available window. If this is urgent, please confirm override of quiet hours.
